.for-http

  %h3.first HTTP

  %p We use HTTP response codes to indicate if anything went wrong whilst we were processing your request.

  %ul
    %li <code>200</code> - OK, everything worked as expected.
    %li <code>202</code> - accepted, the request was accepted and stored for <a href='/background_processing.html'>background processing</a> but may be rejected later if it is invalid
    %li <code>400</code> - bad request, missing a required parameter, or incorrect format
    %li <code>401</code> - unauthorized, missing or invalid API token/secret key
    %li <code>402</code> - payment required, your account's free trial has expired (including a 28 day grace period)
    %li <code>404</code> - not found, the requested method or item doesn't exist
    %li <code>500</code>, <code>502</code>, <code>503</code>, <code>504</code> - server errors, these are on us :(

  %p We'll also send some more information in the body of the response:

  %code.json
    :escaped
      {
        "status": "error",
        "code": 401, # repeats the HTTP status code, useful if using the force_200 argument
        "exception": "TrakioAPI::Exceptions::InvalidToken", # The exception class raised
        "message": "Missing or invalid API token.", # The message for the raised exception
        "details": "You must povide a valid API token, see http://docs.tra.io/authentication.html." # Additional details for the specific error
      }
